# StraddlingBoundaries
a short video game that incapsulates the frustration of trying to find success in the American education system as a mixed ethnicity student. In my game, I force the player to take on my own perspective as they traverse the American K-12 education system and strive for what is the ultimate success (or at least what is perceived to be the ultimate success) of a student: admission to Harvard University. The player is intended to progress through the system, all while meandering the various hurdles and obstacles in his/her way as well as “straddling the boundary” between being too Hispanic and too white. The too “Hispanic” area of the screen is denoted by the brown, leftmost part of the screen, and the too “white” area of the screen is denoted by the white, rightmost part of the screen. Both of these areas begin to encompass more and more of the screen as the player progresses through his/her education. If the player slips up and falls or veers too close to the “Hispanic” or “white” side of the screen, they are forced to repeat whichever part of their education they were currently in.
